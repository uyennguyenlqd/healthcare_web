    question: "How can I get help if I'm stuck on a challenge?",
    answer:
      "The best (and quickest) way to get help on a challenge is in our Discord server. There are thousands of other developers in there, so it's a great place to ask questions. We even have a dedicated \"help\" channel! If you haven't joined yet, you can get an invite to our Discord server here.",

    question: "How do I submit my solution?",
    answer:
      "We'd recommend reading our complete guide to submitting solutions . If you get stuck and need help, please feel free to ask questions in our Discord server, and we'll help you submit your project.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is there an official solution I can take a look at?",
    answer:
      "We don't provide \"official\" solutions for the challenges. This is because there is no single perfect way to complete a challenge. Instead, you're encouraged to review other people's code in the community. You can learn so much by seeing how other people have approached the same challenges and giving them feedback.",
